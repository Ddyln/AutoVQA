# Task

Generate exactly ONE Question-Answer pairs in Vietnamese based on the image given. Pair must be Reasoning Level {target_level}.

# Reasoning Level Definitions

- Level 1 (Perception): Identifying objects, colors, counts, or basic text (Category: "Xác định đối tượng", "Xác định số lượng").
- Level 2 (Spatial/Description): Describing positions, simple actions, or scene composition (Category: "Mô tả vị trí", "Mô tả hành động").
- Level 3 (Relational): Analyzing interactions between objects or comparing attributes (Category: "Mối quan hệ", "Câu hỏi so sánh").
- Level 4 (Contextual Reasoning): Inferring context, reasons, or time of day based on visual clues (Category: "Lý do/ Nhân quả", "Suy luận ngữ cảnh").
- Level 5 (Abstract/Hypothetical): Complex inference about emotions, future events, or unstated goals based on the image (Category: "Suy luận ngữ cảnh", "Lý do/ Nhân quả").

# Requirements

1. Questions:
   - Must be in natural, native-sounding Vietnamese.
   - Must be answerable only using the visual information implied by the caption.
   - Avoid generic questions like "Cái này là gì?". Be specific to the scene.
2. Answers:
   - Provide exactly 5 distinct, short answers (1-10 words) for the question.
   - Answers must simulate different annotators (e.g., synonyms, slightly different phrasing).
   - Truthfulness: All answers must be correct according to the image.
